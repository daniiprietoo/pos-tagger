# Instruction to run

The project was developed using the environment created by the Dockerfile at the beginning of the semester (at USC).

# Choices

- Run `metric_testing.ipnyb` for the full experiment on models. Takes a long time to run (Trains +40 models)

- Run `BiLSTM_inference.ipynb` for a short test in 3 languages whith a configurable model.
